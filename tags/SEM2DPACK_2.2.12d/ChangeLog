 ++ built-in mesh generation for layered medium
    possibly with surface and sub-surface topography
    See MESH_LAYERED input block

    in fem_grid.f90 (FE_SetConnectivity)
 *+ fixed array allocation bug in spline_dist.f90
 o+ optimization settings in module constants.f90
    should be modified by user before compilation
  + file format changed in DIST_SPLINE, DIST_LINEAR, 
    DIST_GRADIENT, REC_LINE and SRC_DEF :
    the first line (which used to contain the number of data lines)
    is not needed anymore

Wed Apr  4 10:21:55 CEST 2007 -- v2.2.9
 *+ fixed reading of HETE_DIST1 input block
    and more robust interpolation at the edges
    BR 1692766

    See SRC_USER input block
    FR 1691682
  + new example "LambsProblem", as in Mercerat et al. (2006)
    SR 1681080

Mon Mar 12 05:06:31 CET 2007 -- v2.2.8
 ++ receivers can be located at arbitrary positions, read from a file, 
    not necesarily at computational nodes. See the REC_LINE block
    FR 1639079
 ++ multiple sources, with location and delay-time read from a file.
    See SRC_DEF block
    FR 1675299

Thu Feb  8 16:52:09 CET 2007 -- v2.2.7
 ++ materials can have heterogeneous distributions using DIST_XXXXX blocks
    (see EXAMPLE/InaBox)
    SR 1631862
 ++ new DIST_HETE1 interpolates linearly from a regular grid (see EXAMPLE/InaBox)
 *+ fixed bug when writing "Stability_sem2d.tab"
  + added a FAQ to the user's guide
    SR 1653849 1648483

Thu Jan 18 16:21:36 CET 2007 -- v2.2.6
  + Kelvin-Voigt viscosity: fixed wrong format in initialization outputs
  + PRE/ViewMeshQuality.m: modified, see user's guide section 2.4
  + EXAMPLES/TestFlt1D/ : corrected Par.inp

Wed Nov  1 22:45:39 CET 2006 -- v2.2.5
 ++ symplectic time-stepping algorithms, PFR and PEFRL (4th order)
 o+ Reverse Cuthill-McKee element reordering
  + PostScript snapshots for each component in P-SV
 *+ abort if undefined boundary tag
 *+ first sample in seismograms is t=0
 *+ added Kelvin-Voigt to Newmark solver

Wed Jan 18 10:51:01 CET 2006 -- v2.2.4a
 *+ Kelvin-Voigt routines fixed for g95 compiler

Mon Aug 22 22:55:56 CEST 2005 -- v2.2.4
 ++ SH waves (anti-plane, scalar wave equation), see "ndof=1" in &GENERAL 
 ++ leapfrog (staggered centered-difference) is now the default time scheme
    It is faster, uses less memory and allows accurate explicit treatment
    of dynamic fault boundaries (see "kind" in &TIME)
 ++ Kelvin-Voigt material, only with leapfrog (see &KELVIN_VOIGT)
 ++ bc_abso: new implementation, absorbing boundaries are now second order in dt
 *+ faults: mapping to the fault coordinate system was handled incorrectly
    (this bug might have corrupted curved faults in P-SV)
 *+ time scheme: consistent check for stability in dissipative schemes
 o+ faster initialization (changed the node numbering algorithm)
 o+ optimization: up to 50% performance gain by declaring NGLL as parameter 
    in core subroutines (ELAST_KD). Before compiling, the user must edit elastic.f90
    setting OPT_NGLL to a frequent value.
 o+ memory optimization: jacobian and local weights not stored
  + faults: input initial tractions renamed + new input initial stress 
  + outputs: PostScript snapshots of color scalar fields 
    (set "vector=F, color=T" in PLOT_POSTSCRIPT) 
  + post: sem2d_view.m for Matlab
  + post: "Snapshot_*.ps" renamed to "x_*.ps" where x=d,v or a.

Mon Feb  7 23:38:44 CET 2005 -- v2.2.3
  + outputs: binary formats, see "bin" option in PLOTS
             field selector "fields"
             stress and strain outputs
  + pre- and post-process: tools for visualization under gnuplot and Matlab,
	for conversion of output to ascii (see PRE/ and POST/)
  + post: movie.csh runs now with animate (ImageMagick) instead of xanim
        and gifsicle instead of gifmerge
  + doc: more about the method, mesh verification, output formats 
 *+ bc_swfflt: NSAMP in output header file was inaccurate
 *+ mesh_cartesian, mesh_emc2 and init: bugs higlighted by g95 compiler (G.Wimpey)

lun Aug 9 20:15:09 EDT 2004 -- v2.2.2
 *+ Intel fixed their bug in the "transfer" intrinsic,
    the code now works with Intel compiler ifort, version 8.0.046_pe047.1
 *+ fixed bug in the numbering algorithm
  + fixed POST/movie.csh

jeu nov 13 20:02:09 EST 2003 -- v2.2.1
 *+ emc2, cracks and faults: bug fixed in the handling of crack tip nodes.
    As a new convention, crack tip nodes must be assigned a special tag: -1.

mar oct 28 17:08:10 EST 2003 -- v2.2
 ++ boundary conditions: new kind BC_SWFFLT, slip weakening fault
 *+ boundary conditions: bug fixed in the numbering subroutine
  + seismograms: fixed the scripts (don't need ShowSeis_sem2d.csh anymore)
  + time scheme: parameterized dissipation in explicit Newmark-alpha
 o+ solver: optimized for memory
  + distributions: new kind PWCONR 

jeu oct 23 15:13:48 EDT 2003 -- v2.1beta

  + "Periodic" flag in BC_ABSORB
  + doc: explanation of seismograms data format
