BUGS:
+ conflict between bc_abso and analytical incident field when the boundary
  is not really receiving the incident wave (see EXAMPLES/LinearSlipLaw)
  => add a flag to the BC_ABSO input block

SOLVER FUNCTIONALITIES:
+ PML/other absorbing layers
? switch bc_abso to more classical implementation 
  => only possible with first order paraxial (see SEM_matlab)
+ sub-cycling for coupling in two scales simulation 
+ domain decomposition database, for MPI test and multidomain coupling
? non-conformal mesh with mortar elements
? triangles
+ broad band source: Berlage, user supplied
+ noise sources
+ moment tensor sources
+ Choice plot/save_data

PACKAGE:
+ add compiler_variable to Makefile
? Self-documentation: evaluate a2ps stylesheet, texinfo, f90doc
? avoid unnecessary recompilation of modules (www.theochem.uwa.edu.au/fortran/recompile)

DOC:
+ emc2: quadrangulate domains for structured regions

SRC OPTIMIZATION/CLEANING:
+ allow single precision
+ Optimize memory: clean or never store arrays not used by solver (xjaci,weights)
? partition interior/skeleton nodes (spec_grid.init_numbering) -> assembly
? more element oriented approach...  may degrade performance
  => try first with the internal-forces

OUTPUTS/POST:
+ move postscript out of the code, output only raw data and 
  post-processing scripts
+ color snapshots of scalar fields --> movies
+ 1D response: Fabian Bonilla's contrib
+ Nakamura's H/V method (script)
+ update the 1.x tools (movies, 1D model response)
+ try DISLIN or other f90 graphics libs
+ fix model colors in PostScript snapshots /interpol/subsampling
+ seismograms: input sampling rate instead of number of timesteps (interpolate?)
+ matlab scripts ...
