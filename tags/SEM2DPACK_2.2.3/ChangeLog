	  ++ important new feature
	   + less important modifications

Mon Feb  7 23:38:44 CET 2005 -- v2.2.3
  + outputs: binary formats, see "bin" option in PLOTS
             field selector "fields"
             stress and strain outputs
  + pre- and post-process: tools for visualization under gnuplot and Matlab,
	for conversion of output to ascii (see PRE/ and POST/)
  + post: movie.csh runs now with animate (ImageMagick) instead of xanim
        and gifsicle instead of gifmerge
  + doc: more about the method, mesh verification, output formats 
 *+ bc_swfflt: NSAMP in output header file was inaccurate
 *+ mesh_cartesian, mesh_emc2 and init: bugs higlighted by g95 compiler (G.Wimpey)

lun aoû  9 20:15:09 EDT 2004 -- v2.2.2
 *+ Intel fixed their bug in the "transfer" intrinsic,
