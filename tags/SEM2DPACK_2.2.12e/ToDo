     + attenuation Q with coarse-grained variables
     + Perfectly Matched Layers
     + poro-elasticity

 Sources:
     + src_gen: add amplitude to input file for mutiple sources
     + broad band sources: Gaussian, Morlet, Berlage
     + allow sources not at node
     + noise sources
 Boundary conditions:
     + bc_abso: handle "side" internally

        . rate-and-state
        . rate-and-state with strong velocity-weakening
        . bimaterial regularization
     + higher order ABC for SH
     + time-dependent Dirichlet conditions
     + Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on non vertical/horizontal boundaries
     + spatially non uniform Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions
 Other:
     + domain decomposition database, for MPI test and multidomain coupling
     + domain reduction method with boundary traction data
     + a few triangles, Fekete or other
     + sub-cycling for simulations with disparate time-scales 
     + non-conformal mesh with mortar elements
     + implicit dynamic solvers (test pre-conditionners, blended mass)
     + implicit/explicit partitioning near small geometrical features
     + implicit quasi-static solvers with conjugate gradient 
     + soil-structure interaction (see QUAD4M, etc)
     
MESHER:
[1]  + kinked and curved faults 
[2]  + add surrounding strip of elements for PML
     + automated meshing starting with a triangulation: 
       Triangle (http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html)
        -->  CQmesh (http://www.dct.ufms.br/~marcelo/cqmesh.html)
         --> QMPP (http://www.dct.ufms.br/~marcelo/qmpp.html)
          --> SEM2DPACK 
     + element quality metrics
     
REFACTORING:
     + 'domain' object
     + encapsulate echo MSG...OK
     
OPTIMIZATION:
     + improve data locality
     + more element oriented approach...  may degrade performance
       => try first with the internal-forces
     + allow single precision
     
INPUTS/OUTPUTS/POST:
     + GMT scripts for snapshot plots
     + matlab snapshots with tricontour
     + seismograms: input sampling rate instead of number of timesteps (interpolate)
     + interpol/subsampling in all snapshot outputs
     + gnuplot plotting scripts: pm3d, vectors
     + 1D response: integrate Fabian Bonilla's contrib
     + update the 1.x tools (1D model response)
     + Nakamura's H/V method (script)
     + engineering outputs: PGA, PGV, response spectra, etc
     + Graphical User Interface front end

DOCUMENTATION:
     + add guidelines for advanced users on how-to implement new 
       materials, outputs, distributions, sources, friction laws, boundary conditions
     + improve self-documentation script: make latex output, test RoboDoc or similar
     + emc2: detailed example of quadrangulate domains for structured regions
     + add a list of papers that use SEM2DPACK
     + add description of the physics
     
PACKAGING:
     + tests for each main feature
     + create a SubVersion project
     + avoid unnecessary recompilation of modules (www.theochem.uwa.edu.au/fortran/recompile)
     + add compiler_variable to Makefile
