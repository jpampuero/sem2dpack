EXAMPLES/TestFlt2D_SCEC_TPV3_antiplane

This example is a 2D antiplane (mode III) version of the
SCEC TPV3 benchmark problem: a dynamic rupture problem 
on a vertical cross-section across a vertical strike-slip fault 
governed by linear slip-weakening friction.
The model parameters are described in Day et al. (JGR 2005).

The mesh was obtained by running PRE/mesh2d/mesh2D_ex0.m 
with the default values. The default element size is h=500m.
Setting ngll=6 in Par.inp, sets the average node spacing on 
the fault to dx = h/(ngll-1) = 100m.

A Kelvin-Voigt viscous layer around the fault plane helps
preventing spurious high-frequency oscillations.
