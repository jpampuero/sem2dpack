INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

1. Uncompress and expand the SEM2DPACK package:
	tar xvfz sem2dpack.tgz
2. Go to the source directory: 
	cd SEM2DPACK/SRC
3. Edit the Makefile according to your FORTRAN 90 compiler.
4. Compile: 
	make
5. Go to the SEM2DPACK/POST directory, edit the Makefile, then compile.

On normal compilation you end up with executable files,
among which sem2dsolve, in your /home/myhome/bin/.

If you encounter problems with some (convenient but non essential) FORTRAN 95 
features of the code please contact me.
