# SEM2PACK

## A spectral element method for 2D wave propagation and fracture dynamics, with emphasis on computational seismology and earthquake source dynamics.

--------------------------------
## Features

  * Elastic and inelastic wave propagation in heterogeneous media
  * Rupture dynamics on non-planar faults, with friction and off-fault damage or plasticity
  * High order (spectral) elements on unstructured meshes
